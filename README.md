## Introduction:
 FunFinder is an app that allows users to view and schedule activities for children based on age group and time of day. Parents can create an account, view a list of activities, and filter them by age group and time of day. They can then schedule those activities for specific times. Activities can be created and edited by users.

## Features:

• Age and time filter: users can view a list of activities based on age group and time of day
• Scheduling: users can schedule activities for specific times
• CRUD functionality: users can create, read, update, and delete activities and schedules
• Reciprocal many-to-many relationship: users can associate themselves with multiple activities, and activities can have multiple associated users

## Technologies:
• Front-end: React
• Back-end: Ruby on Rails
• Database: PostgreSQL

## MVP: 
• User authentication
